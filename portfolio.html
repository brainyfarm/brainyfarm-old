<p>Coding is to me what the pen is to a writer, programming gives you power beyond the imaginable. I currently work developing web and mobile applications</p>

<p>In my short lifetime, I have read hundreds of books, thousands of Wikipedia articles, ten thousand single page flyers and blog posts and lot more</p>

<p>What are the odds of humans making contact with extraterrestrial intelligence in my lifetime? What if they are here already but exists in a different dimension? What is the true nature of reality? These are few of the questions that keeps awake at night.</p>
