<h2 class="section-heading">I Have a Hundred Problems</h2>

<p> In the words of Dale Carnegie, I have come to realise that most of the problems I worry about would not happen but my worrying is damaging to me </p>

<p> Here is a quote from me </p>
<a href="#">

</a>
<span class="caption text-muted"> I had 100 problems last month, 99 were diagnosed to be imaginary. This month must be bad though, I have 98 already</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>
